      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a recent theatre graduate from SDSU looking to diversify my skill set with the hopes of transitioning to a more stable career during these unpredictable times.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Encinitas, California.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy cooking, making cocktails, woodworking, home improvement, creating and discussing theatre and film, and gaming.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to make my living as an actor on the stage and screen, a path I plan to pursue again when the timing is right. I also have goals of owning my own property rental business of houses I have designed and renovated myself.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I am currently renting a studio in Mission Hills. The place is small but comfortable, something I better start getting used to because tiny living and van life are definitely on my horizon. I like the area a lot and because I moved in during quarantine, I am looking forward to trying all the restaurants and bars when they start opening back up.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I believe the skills required are incredibly versatile and valuable in almost every area I am interested in. You cannot operate a business in this day and age without a website and I have seen first hand at my current job the havoc a poorly designed website can wreak on the operations of an enterprise. I want to be part of the solution for turning business concepts into a reality.</p>
